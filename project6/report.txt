NOTABLE OBSTACLES: 
1. failing to utilize the enumerations in the switch 
2. including the wrong header files in the BeetleGame.cpp file 
3. putting the logic of BeetleGame inside the Beetle.cpp file 

LIST OF TEST DATA:
    BeetleGame g;
    g.humanRoll(1);
    assert(g.humanPlay() == false);
    g.humanRoll(6);
    assert(g.humanPlay());
    assert(!(g.gameIsOver())); 

    TESTS THAT HUMANROLL WITH AN INPUT WORKS AS A CHEATING ROLL AND THAT THE FIRST ROLL MUST BE A 6.
    ALSO TESTS THAT THE GAMEISOVER FUNCTION WORKS 

    g.computerRoll(2);
    assert(g.computerPlay() == false);
    g.computerRoll(6);
    assert(g.computerPlay()); 
    assert(!(g.gameIsOver()));

    TESTS TO SEE IF COMPUTERROLL CAN BE CHEATED BY GIVING AN INPUT, ALSO TESTS THAT THE GAME MUST BEGIN WITH 6

    Beetle d;
    d.buildBody();
    assert(d.hasBody());
    assert(!(d.hasAntenna1()));
    assert(!(d.hasAntenna2()));
    assert(!(d.hasEye1()));
    assert(!(d.hasEye2()));
    assert(!(d.hasHead()));
    assert(!(d.hasLeg1()));
    assert(!(d.hasLeg2()));
    assert(!(d.hasLeg3()));
    assert(!(d.hasLeg4()));

    TESTS THAT THE BEETLE INITIALLY DOES NOT HAVE ANY BODY PARTS 

    
    d.buildHead();
    assert(d.hasHead());

    TEST THAT THE BUILDHEAD FUNCTION WORKS AS INTENDED 

    d.buildAntenna();
    assert(!(d.hasAntenna2()));
    assert(d.hasAntenna1());
    d.buildAntenna();
    assert(d.hasAntenna2());

    TEST THAT THE BUILD ANTENNA FUNCTION WORKS AS INTENDED

    d.buildEye(); 
    assert(!(d.hasEye2()));
    assert(d.hasEye1());
    d.buildEye();
    assert(d.hasEye2());

    TEST THAT THE BUILD EYE FUNCTION WORKS AS INTENDED 

    d.buildLeg();
    assert(d.hasLeg1());
    assert(!(d.hasLeg2()));
    d.buildLeg();
    assert(d.hasLeg2());
    d.buildLeg();
    assert(d.hasLeg3());
    d.buildLeg();
    assert(d.hasLeg4());

    TEST THAT THE BUILD EYE FUNCTION WORKS AS INTENDED
